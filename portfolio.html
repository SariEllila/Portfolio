        <h2>Hi!</h2>
        <h3>I'm Sari, a front-end developer from Helsinki. My previous work background is in video production, which lead me to do a degree in Graphic Design, and during these studies I developed a keen interest in programming. Since 9 months now I have been studying through workshops and an online platform called Scrimba. However I realized I really love to code and want to up my skills faster, so I just finished a 9-week in-person intensive bootcamp at Barcelona Code School. Please see some of my projects below, and read in more detail about me from my LinkedIn page: </h3>
